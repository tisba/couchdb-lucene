0.5
----------------------

* sniff user agent for _changes vs. _all_docs_by_seq, etc. (Database subclasses)(work in progress -- needs testing against 0.9.1 and 0.10)
* support authentication against couchdb (basic/digest/etc)
* pause/resume control over indexer.
* status page.
* allow POST with a query array?

* Lucene 2.9 - done
** numeric range suppport. (indexing size needs testing -- query side needs post-processing or QP tweak)
* use _local/lucene for recording progress. (recorded but not used to detect inconsistencies yet)
* make attachment call support "store":"yes|no"

UNSCHEDULED

* LuceneDictionary/spellcheck/suggestions mode.
* _show and _list-like support for search results.
* distributed search.
* hit highlighting (lucene contrib).
* clustering (carrot2).
* JSONQuery? (http://docs.persvr.org/documentation/jsonquery)
* geospatial (need TrieRangeQuery from 2.9)

couchdb - store {"uuid":<uuid>} as JSON in _local/lucene
lucene - store {"update_seq":seq,"uuid":<uuid>} as Map in userCommitData

Verify at startup;

if couchdb_uuid == lucene_uuid then

starting index from update_seq.
